<h1>Sherjil's New Website!</h1>
<p>This website is FRESH as the month of June 2021. No CSS, no javascript, just html as<br> of now. It is a website in the making. If you want a useful casual website, either <br> wait a few months for me to finish this website or go to my friends website, <br> https://burgers.my.to/ </p>

<h1>Damn.....</h1>
    <p>I will try my best to make this website look better. Right now, I am having some damn trouble where I can't add css. Please add me on discord for help. Discord = sherjilis#6442
